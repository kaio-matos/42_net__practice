# Net Practice

This project aims to introduce 42 students to networking concepts with static addressing, OSI model, IPv4, routers, switches, and so on.

In the exercises folder, we have the generated JSON for each completed exercise that 42 provided.

In the helper folder, there's a small converter that I created and used for studying purposes.
